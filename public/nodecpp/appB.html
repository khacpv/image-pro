<h1 id="appendix-b-buffers">Appendix B - Buffers</h1>
<p>Chapter 2 of this book covered using typical JavaScript data types when moving data to and from C++ addons. Node.js introduces a new data type, <code>Buffer</code>, which is not found in standard JavaScript (although new versions of JavaScript now have typed arrays, which provide much of the same functionality). Node.js <code>Buffer</code> objects are used to represent raw binary data, similar to a C++ array (in this case, integer array). Whenever you work with Node.js file I/O or TCP you are likely going to work with <code>Buffer</code> objects. While it is common to convert <code>Buffer</code> objects to JavaScript strings (by specifying the encoding of the integer data), often times you may wish to operate directly on the binary data as well.</p>
<p><code>Buffer</code> objects are an interesting aspect OF C++ addon development, first because they are in fact <em>not</em> part of V8 - but part of Node.js. Secondly, <code>Buffer</code> object data is unique in that it is <em>not</em> allocated inside the V8 heap - an attribute that can allow us to sidestep some data copying when dealing with C++ addons and worker threads (which will be discussed below).</p>
<p>In this section, we&#39;ll look at how <code>Buffer</code> objects can be passed to and from C++ addons using NAN. NAN is used because the <code>Buffer</code> object API has actually undergone some significant changes recently, and NAN will shield us from these issues. We&#39;ll look at <code>Buffer</code> objects through the lens of an image converter - specifically converting binary png image data into bitmap formatted binary data.</p>
<p>All of the code for this section is available in full in the <code>nodecpp-demo</code> repository at <a href="https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo">https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo</a>, under the &quot;Buffers&quot; section.</p>
<h2 id="example-png-and-bmp-image-processing">Example: PNG and BMP Image Processing</h2>
<p>Image processing, in general, is anything that manipulates/transforms an image. An image of course is a big chunk of binary data - in it&#39;s most basic state an integer (or 3 or 4) can be used to represent each pixel in an image, and those integers can be stored in a file or held in a contiguously allocated array. Typically image data is not held in <em>raw</em> data form though, it&#39;s compressed/encoded into a image format standard such as png, gif, bmp, jpeg, and others.</p>
<p>Image processing is a good candidate for C++ addons, as image processing can often be time consuming, CPU intensive, and some processing technique have parallelism that C++ can exploit. For the example we&#39;ll look at now, we&#39;ll simply convert png formatted data into bmp formatted data[1]. There are a good number of existing, open source C++ libraries that can help us with this task, I&#39;m going to use LodePNG as it is dependency free and quite simple to use. LodePNG can be found at <a href="http://lodev.org/lodepng/">http://lodev.org/lodepng/</a>, and it&#39;s source code is at <a href="https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng">https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng</a>. Many thanks to the developer, Lode Vandevenne for providing such an easy to use library!</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-addon">Setting up the addon</h2>
<p>For this addon, we&#39;ll create the following directory structure, which includes source code downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng">https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng</a>, namely <code>lodepng.h</code> and <code>lodepng.cpp</code>.</p>
<pre><code>/png2bmp
 | 
 |--- binding.gyp
 |--- package.json
 |--- png2bmp.cpp  # the addon
 |--- index.js     # program to test the addon
 |--- sample.png   # input (will be converted to bmp)
 |--- lodepng.h    # from lodepng distribution
 |--- lodepng.cpp  # From loadpng distribution
</code></pre><p>To download the complete addon, head over to <a href="https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo">https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo</a>, this particular example is in the <code>buffers</code> directory.</p>
<p><code>lodepng.cpp</code> contains all the necessary code for doing image processing, and I will not discuss it&#39;s working in detail. In addition, the lodepng distribution contains sample code that allows you to specifically convert between png and bmp - I&#39;ve adapted it slightly, and will put it in the addon source code file <code>png2bmp.cpp</code> which we will take a look at shortly. Let&#39;s first look at what the actual JavaScript program looks like though - before diving into the addon code itself:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">&#39;use strict&#39;;
const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);
const path = require(&#39;path&#39;);
const png2bmp = require(&#39;./build/Release/png2bmp&#39;);
var png_file = process.argv[2];
var bmp_file = path.basename(png_file, &#39;.png&#39;) + &quot;.bmp&quot;;
var png_buffer = fs.readFileSync(png_file);

png2bmp.saveBMP(bmp_file, png_buffer, png_buffer.length);
</code></pre>
<p>This program simply requires <code>fs</code>, <code>path</code>, and our addon, which will be located at <code>./build/Releast/png2bmp</code>. The program grabs an input (png) filename from the command line arguments and <strong>reads the png into a <code>Buffer</code></strong>. It then sends the <code>Buffer</code> into the addon, which saves the converted BMP to the filename as specified. Thus, the addon is converting png to BMP and saving the results to a file - returning nothing.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the <code>package.json</code>, which is setting up <code>npm start</code> to invoke the <code>index.js</code> program with a command line argument of <code>sample.png</code>. It&#39;s a pretty generic image:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;png2bmp&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,
  &quot;private&quot;: true,
  &quot;gypfile&quot;: true,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node index.js sample.png&quot;
  },
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;nan&quot;: &quot;*&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="imgs/sample.png" alt="sample.png"></p>
<p>Finally, let&#39;s take a look at the <code>binding.gyp</code> file - which is fairly standard, other than the presence of a few compiler flags needed to compile lodepng. It also includes the requisite references to NAN.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;targets&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;target_name&quot;: &quot;png2bmp&quot;,
      &quot;sources&quot;: [ &quot;png2bmp.cpp&quot;, &quot;lodepng.cpp&quot; ], 
      &quot;cflags&quot;: [&quot;-Wall&quot;, &quot;-Wextra&quot;, &quot;-pedantic&quot;, &quot;-ansi&quot;, &quot;-O3&quot;],
      &quot;include_dirs&quot; : [&quot;&lt;!(node -e \&quot;require(&#39;nan&#39;)\&quot;)&quot;]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>png2bmp.cpp</code> will mostly contain V8/NAN code, however it does have one image processing utility function - <code>do_convert</code>, adapted from lodepng&#39;s png to bmp example code. The function accepts a <code>vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;</code> containing input data (png format) and a <code>vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;</code> to put it&#39;s output (bmp format) data into. That function in turn calls <code>encodeBMP</code>, which is straight from the lodepng examples. Here is the full code listing of these two functions. The details are not important to understanding addon <code>Buffer</code> objects, but are included here for completeness. Our addon entry point(s) will call <code>do_convert</code>.</p>

<p>Sorry... that listing was long, but it&#39;s important to see what&#39;s actually going on! Let&#39;s get to work bridging all this code to JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="passing-buffers-to-an-addon">Passing buffers to an addon</h2>
<p>Our first task is to create the <code>saveBMP</code> addon function, which accepts a filename (destination BMP) along with the png data. The png image data is actually read when we are in JavaScript, so it&#39;s passed in as a Node.js <code>Buffer</code>. The first rule to recognize is that <code>Buffer</code> is unknown to V8, it&#39;s a Node.js construct. We&#39;ll use NAN to access the buffer itself (and later create new <code>Buffer</code> objects). Whenever <code>Buffer</code> objects are passed to C++ addons, it is necessary to specify it&#39;s length as an added parameter, as it&#39;s difficult to ascertain the actual data length of a <code>Buffer</code> from C++.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s set up the first function call in NAN:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">
NAN_METHOD(SaveBMP) {
    v8::String::Utf8Value val(info[0]-&gt;ToString());
    std::string outfile (*val);

    ....
}

NAN_MODULE_INIT(Init) {
   Nan::Set(target, 
    New&lt;String&gt;(&quot;saveBMP&quot;).ToLocalChecked(),
    GetFunction(New&lt;FunctionTemplate&gt;(SaveBMP))
      .ToLocalChecked());
}

NODE_MODULE(basic_nan, Init)
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>SaveBMP</code>, the first step we do is a simple extraction of the output filename. Next, we must extract the binary data (which will be represented by <code>unsigned char</code> data).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">unsigned char* buffer = 
  (unsigned char*) node::Buffer::Data(info[1]-&gt;ToObject());

unsigned int size = info[2]-&gt;Uint32Value();
</code></pre>
<p>Notice just how easy this is... Node.js provides a static <code>Data</code> method on the <code>Buffer</code> class that accepts a standard <code>v8::Object</code> handle and returns an <code>unsigned char</code> pointer to the underlying data. This pointer <strong>does NOT</strong> point to data managed by V8 recall - it&#39;s on the normal C++ heap and can be worked with as such. We also extract the size from the third argument to the addon function.</p>
<p>Often in C++ we prefer to deal with STL containers rather than raw memory arrays, so we can easily create a <code>vector</code> from this pointer - which we need to do in order to call <code>do_convert</code>. Below is the full code listing - which converts the buffer&#39;s data pointer to a vector, calls <code>do_convert</code> which works it&#39;s magic to fill in bmp data into the vector we give it, and finally saves it to the desired output file (using a lodepng utility call - <code>save_file</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">NAN_METHOD(SaveBMP) {
  v8::String::Utf8Value val(info[0]-&gt;ToString());
  std::string outfile (*val);

  // Convert the Node.js Buffer into a C++ Vector
  unsigned char*buffer = 
    (unsigned char*) node::Buffer::Data(info[1]-&gt;ToObject());

  unsigned int size = info[2]-&gt;Uint32Value();
  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; png_data(buffer, buffer + size);

  // Convert to bmp, stored in another vector.    
  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; bmp; 
  if ( do_convert(png_data, bmp)) {
      info.GetReturnValue().Set(Nan::New(false)); 
  }
  else {
      lodepng::save_file(bmp, outfile);    
      info.GetReturnValue().Set(Nan::New(true));
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run this program by doing an <code>npm install</code> and then an <code>npm start</code> and you&#39;ll see a <code>sample.bmp</code> generated that looks eerily similar to <code>sample.png</code>, just a whole lot bigger (bmp compression is far less efficient than png).</p>
<h2 id="returning-buffers-from-addon">Returning buffers from addon</h2>
<p>This addon would be a lot more flexible if we simply returned the bitmap image data, rather than needing to save it to a file while within C++. To do this, we must learn how to return <code>Buffer</code> objects. This concept, on the surface, seems easy enough - you can look at examples on NAN&#39;s website to see new <code>Buffer</code>s being created in C++ and returned to JavaScript. Upon closer look though, there are some issues we must be careful with, which we&#39;ll tackle here.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s create a new addon entry point - <code>getBMP</code> - which would be called from JavaScript like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">...
var png_buffer = fs.readFileSync(png_file);

bmp_buffer = png2bmp.getBMP(png_buffer, png_buffer.length);
fs.writeFileSync(bmp_file, bmp_buffer);
</code></pre>
<p>In the original C++ function, we called <code>do_convert</code> which put the bitmap data into a <code>vector&lt;unsigned int&gt;</code> which we wrote to a file. Now we must <em>return</em> that data, by constructing a new <code>Buffer</code> object. NAN&#39;s <code>NewBuffer</code> call aptly does the trick here - let&#39;s look at a first draft of the addon function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">
void buffer_delete_callback(char* data, void* hint) {
    free(data);
}

NAN_METHOD(GetBMP) {
  unsigned char*buffer = 
    (unsigned char*) node::Buffer::Data(info[0]-&gt;ToObject());

  unsigned int size = info[1]-&gt;Uint32Value();

  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; png_data(buffer, buffer + size);
  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; bmp = vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;();

  if ( do_convert(png_data, bmp)) {
      info.GetReturnValue().Set(
          NewBuffer((char *)bmp.data(), 
            bmp.size(), buffer_delete_callback, 0)
            .ToLocalChecked());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code example above follows what most tutorials online advocate. We call <code>NewBuffer</code> with a char * (which we grab from the <code>bmp</code> vector using the <code>data</code> method), the size of the amount of memory we are creating the buffer out of, and then 2 additional parameters that might raise your curiosity. The 3rd parameter to <code>NewBuffer</code> is a callback - which ends up being called when the <code>Buffer</code> you are creating gets garbage collected by V8. Recall, <code>Buffer</code>s are JavaScript objects, whose data is stored outside V8 - but the object itself is under V8&#39;s control. From this perspective, it should make sense that a callback would be handy - when V8 destroys the buffer, we need some way of freeing up the data we have created - which is passed into the callback as it&#39;s first parameter. The signature of the callback is defined by NAN - <code>Nan::FreeCallback()</code>. The seconds parameter is a hint to aid in deallocation, we can use it however we want. It will be helpful soon, but for now we just pass null (0).</p>
<p>So - <em>here is the problem</em> with this code: The data contained in the buffer we return is likely deleted before our JavaScript gets to use it. Why? If you understand C++ well, you likely already see the problem: the <code>bmp</code> vector is going to go out of scope as our <code>GetBMP</code> function returns. C++ vector semantics hold that when the vector goes out of scope, the vector&#39;s destructor will delete all data within the vector - in this case, our bmp data! This is a huge problem, since the <code>Buffer</code> we send back to JavaScript will have it&#39;s data deleted out from under it. You might get away with this (race conditions are fun right?), but it wil eventually cause your program to crash.</p>
<p>How do we get around this? One method is to create a <code>Buffer</code> containing a <em>copy</em> of the <code>bmp</code> vector&#39;s data. We could do this like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">if ( do_convert(png_data, bmp)) {
        info.GetReturnValue().Set(
            CopyBuffer(
              (char *)bmp.data(), 
              bmp.size()).ToLocalChecked());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This indeed is safe, but it involves creating a copy of the data - slow and memory wasting... One way to avoid this whole mess is not to use a vector, and store the bitmap data in a dynamically allocated <code>char *</code> array - however that makes the bitmap conversion code a lot more cumbersome. Thankfully, the answer to this problem, which allows us to still use vectors, is suggested by the the <code>Nan::FreeCallback</code> call signature - namely the <code>hint</code> parameter. Since our problem is that the vector containing bitmap data goes out of scope, we can instead <em>dynamically</em> allocate the vector itself, and pass it into the free callback, where it can be properly deleted when the <code>Buffer</code> has been garbage collected. Below is the completed solution - take careful note now that we are utilizing the <code>hint</code> parameter in our callback, and that we are using a dynamically allocated (heap) vector instead of a stack variable.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">void buffer_delete_callback(char* data, void* the_vector) {
  delete reinterpret_cast&lt;vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; *&gt; (the_vector);
}

NAN_METHOD(GetBMP) {

  unsigned char*buffer = 
    (unsigned char*) node::Buffer::Data(info[0]-&gt;ToObject());
  unsigned int size = info[1]-&gt;Uint32Value();

  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; png_data(buffer, buffer + size);

  // allocate the vector on the heap because we 
  // are building a buffer out of it&#39;s data to 
  // return to Node - and don&#39;t want to allow
  // it to go out of scope until the buffer 
  // does (see buffer_delete_callback).

  std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; * bmp = new vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;();

  if ( do_convert(png_data, *bmp)) {
      info.GetReturnValue().Set(
          NewBuffer((char *)bmp-&gt;data(), 
            bmp-&gt;size(), buffer_delete_callback, bmp)
            .ToLocalChecked());
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you run the program, JavaScript will now safely be able to operate on the returned <code>Buffer</code> without needing to worry about <code>vector</code> deleting the memory.</p>
<h2 id="buffers-as-a-solution-to-the-worker-thread-copying-problem">Buffers as a solution to the worker thread copying problem</h2>
<p>Reading the segment above, you might recall a discussion in Chapter 4 regarding V8 memory and worker threads. We had a significant issue when using asynchronous addons, in that C++ threads created to do the asynchronous work could <em>never</em> access V8 data directly. There was no real solution to this problem, other than creating a copy of the data in C++ heap space. For lots of addons, this if fine - however as was suggested at the time, when moving large amounts of data between JavaScript and C++ this is a real issue. Now we have a glimpse at a possible solution - allocating data as <code>Buffer</code> objects!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s develop an asynchronous version of the png to bitmap converter. We&#39;ll perform the actual conversion in a C++ worker thread, using <code>Nan::AsyncWorker</code>. Through the use of <code>Buffer</code> objects however, we will be no need to create a copy of the png data - we will only need to hold a pointer to the underlying data such that our worker thread can access it. Likewise, the data produced by the worker thread (the <code>bmp</code> vector can be used to create a new <code>Buffer</code> without copying data, as shown above. Since we&#39;ve worked with <code>AsyncWorker</code> a lot already in this book, I&#39;ll simply show you the code below - it&#39;s pretty straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp"> class PngToBmpWorker : public AsyncWorker {
    public:
    PngToBmpWorker(Callback * callback, 
        v8::Local&lt;v8::Object&gt; &amp;pngBuffer, int size) 
        : AsyncWorker(callback) {
        unsigned char*buffer = 
          (unsigned char*) node::Buffer::Data(pngBuffer);

        std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; tmp(
          buffer, 
          buffer +  (unsigned int) size);

        png_data = tmp;
    }
    void Execute() {
       bmp = new vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;();
       do_convert(png_data, *bmp);
    }

<p>Now we&#39;ve got an asynchronous function to get the bitmap encoded data too - without any copying of data unnecessarily.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">png2bmp.getBMPAsync(png_buffer, 
  png_buffer.length,
  function(bmp_buffer) {
    fs.writeFileSync(bmp_file, bmp_buffer);
});
</code></pre>
<p>[1] Converting from png to bmp is <em>not</em> particularly time consuming, it&#39;s probably overkill for an addon - but it&#39;s good for demonstration purposes. If you are looking for a pure JavaScript implementation of image processing (including much more than png to bmp conversion), take a look at JIMP at <a href="">https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp</a><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp">https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp</a>.</p>
