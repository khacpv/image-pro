<title>C++ and Node.js Integration</title>

<h1 id="about-this-book">About this book</h1>
<p>I began programing in C++ as a student, almost 20 years ago and I haven&#39;t stopped using it both professionally and as a professor ever since. Most of my professional work involves web development however - and after doing many projects in many different languages and frameworks, no platform has made me more happy than Node.js. In 2014, while working on a project to integrate a legacy C++ tool (genomic sequence alignment) with a new web app, I stumbled upon C++ addons for Node.js. The chance to integrate two languages that I enjoy working with was exciting, so I began to teach myself how to write addons from resources online.</p>
<p><em>It was painful!</em></p>
<p>Not long after I put together my first few addons, I decided to write this book. Over the course of about a year and a half, I&#39;ve written dozens of addons, researched the way V8 and Node.js work, I read pretty much every SO and blog post on the internet dealing with the topic. This book is my effort to synthesis all that I&#39;ve learned into a complete handbook - to save you the trouble I went through getting up to speed.</p>
<p>This book is <em>not</em> a reference manual. You won&#39;t find exhaustive API listings here, the book is written around examples - focusing on <em>concepts</em> - not facts that you can find in API docs. I want this to be a <em>practical guide</em> for creating addons - I hope you find it helpful. As you read the book, you&#39;ll no doubt want to keep V8 and Node.js documentation handy, as they are indispensable.</p>
<p>This book contains a <em>lot</em> of source code listings. In order to make things look ok for a variety of ebook formats, I&#39;ve severely limited the number of columns I use for code - which at times makes things look a bit strange. I highly recommend that you visit my github repository, <code>nodecpp-demo</code>, which contains nearly all the code presented in this book. In each chapter, I&#39;ve referred you to the specific directories within that demo repository where you can find the code being discussed in the text.</p>
<p>You can grab the source code at <a href="https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo">https://github.com/freezer333/nodecpp-demo</a>.</p>
<h1 id="who-is-this-book-for-">Who is this book for?</h1>
<p>This book is for anyone wanting to start out with or learn a bit more about Node.js C++ addons. Although nowhere in the book do I go out of my way to use advanced features of C++ or JavaScript, I do expect the reader to be fairly well familiar with these languages. Towards the middle of the book (Chapter 4), the book takes a more technical turn - dealing with issues such as threading and shared memory. I try to explain these topics a bit, however generally speaking the reader should already have a bit of multi-threaded programming experience before trying to absorb those examples. While I&#39;ve used some new(ish) C++ features in my addons, most anyone with a moderate level of C++ experience should have little problem digesting the code.</p>
<p>This book is <em>not</em> for someone trying to learn Node.js, nor is it for someone whose never programmed in C++. While all the source code is freely available at the book&#39;s github repository, please keep in mind that I&#39;ve creating the examples for educational purposes - I&#39;m quite positive there are ways to optimize the code or make the code more &quot;production ready&quot;, but when in doubt I&#39;ve opted for simplicity. Further along those lines, while using C++ for really heavy lifting sometimes gives you a performance boost over pure JavaScript - none of the examples shown in this book are likely to be justified by a performance increase. They are specifically designed to be simple demonstrations to teach you how to integrate the two languages.</p>
<p>Node.js has many versions, at the time of this writing version 6.0 is readying for release. I&#39;ve geared most examples and discussion for Node.js versions 0.12 and above, and all examples have been tested on Node.js v5 and below.</p>
<p>Regarding versions, and creating &quot;production ready&quot; code - I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t explain my choice of introducing NAN, an abstraction library that shields developers from version changes, so late in the book (Chapter 6). My goal for this book is to <em>educate the concepts</em> of addon development, and I found that by learning the basic V8-level API first (which I did, somewhat accidentally), one is better able to understand NAN and it&#39;s higher level abstractions. As you progress through the book, you&#39;ll see that the more advanced concepts (progress async workers, streaming) are discussed <em>after</em> NAN, so we can use the simplifications it provides. My advice to anyone learning addons is to learn the &quot;V8 way&quot; first, but to write final production code using NAN.</p>

<h1 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>I&#39;d like to first thank the hundreds of fellow developers who have make their code, their questions, and their blog articles freely available online - without their willingness to put the information out there I can&#39;t imagine I would have been able to learn this subject or write this book.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to thank all the people who signed up for updates about the development of this book at my <a href="http://scottfrees.com">website</a>. The steady stream of signups, blog post feedback, and just general engagement gave me the motivation I needed to finish this book.</p>
<p>I&#39;d of course also like to thank my family - my wife Sarah and my daughter Abigail - for putting up with me working on yet another project!</p>
